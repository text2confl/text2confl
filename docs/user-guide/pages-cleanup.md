# Maintaining documents tree

In addition to uploading pages, text2confl can also remove pages that are detected as "orphans", i.e. those that are no
longer part of the documents tree.

There are 3 modes available:

1. (default) Delete orphaned "managed" pages
2. Delete all orphaned pages
3. Do not delete any page

## Managed page removal

Page is considered managed if its content was uploaded by text2confl.

## All pages removal

This mode will remove any page that is not part of uploaded document tree
