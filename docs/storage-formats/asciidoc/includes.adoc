:included_path: _assets/

link:{adocs}[Include functionality] of AsciiDoc is supported as expected - included page is not published separately (unless it is discoverable) and just inlined in main page.

[TIP]
====
If you don't want to publish included page on its own, prefix it with `+_+` symbol, e.g. `+_included_page.adoc+`, because *text2confl* ignores files prefixed with `+_+`
====

=== Example

If you have a file
[source,asciidoc,subs="none"]
._assets/included.adoc
----
include::_assets/included.adoc[]
----

You can include it with:

----
:included_path: _assets/

\include::_assets/included.adoc[]
----

And here it goes:

include::_assets/included.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
`included_path` attribute helps properly resolve assets. Read more about path resolutions in link:{adocs}[official docs].
