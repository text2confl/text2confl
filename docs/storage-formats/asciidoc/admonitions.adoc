= AsciiDoc - admonitions
:keywords: supported-format,asciidoc

AsciiDoc's admonitions converted to note, tip, warning and info blocks.

== Block admonitions

Mapping:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
| AsciiDoc | Confluence

|
....
include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=adm-note]
....
| include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=adm-note]

|
....
include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=adm-tip]
....
| include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=adm-tip]


|
....
include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=adm-caution]
....
| include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=adm-caution]

|
....
include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=adm-warning]
....
| include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=adm-warning]

|
....
include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=adm-important]
....
| include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=adm-important]
|===

NOTE: Title that you set to admonition is translated to title of the Confluence macro block.
This works for all of them.

== Single paragraph admonitions

Short syntax for admonitions works too:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
| AsciiDoc | Confluence

|
....
WARNING: Important message to keep in mind
....
| WARNING: Important message to keep in mind
