# Markdown - links, images and other attachments

## Links

[**text2confl**](https://github.com/zeldigas/text2confl) supports both [external] links as well cross-linking to
another [pages](../../storage-formats.md) or [anchors inside page](../../storage-formats.md#markdown). If you need to put a
link to [anchor on same page](#images) it is supported too.

## Images

You can embed images - both external and attached to page. Images support attributes that you can use to customize their
alignment and width/height.

External:

![Octocat](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)

Attached:

![markdown logo](./markdown.png){width=200}
