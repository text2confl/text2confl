## Links

[**text2confl**](https://github.com/zeldigas/text2confl) supports both [external](https://example.org) links as well cross-linking to another [pages](wiki://DOCS/[text2confl] Storage formats) or [anchors inside page](wiki://DOCS/[text2confl] Storage formats#markdown). If you need to put a link to [anchor on same page](#images) it is supported too.
