## Text styling

All basic styling features are supported --- text can be **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~ or mixed one like **bold with *emphasis* part**, all ***bold and italic***. For those who need ~subscript~ or ^superscript^ text - it is supported as well.

You can also use quotation blocks:
> This is a quote
>
> Spanning multiple paragraphs **styled** and `monoscript`

## Lists

Both numbered and bullet lists are supported:

1. one
2. two
3. three
    * unordered
    * list
    * as nested
        1. And ordered
        2. again

Simple task lists are supported too, but due to limitations of Confluence no mixed items are supported.

This will work:

* [ ] not done
* [x] done

But this will not work:

* \[ \] not done
* \[x\] done
* simple item
